#   A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicolor_cat" target="_blank">bicolor cat</a> is a cat with white fur combined with fur of some other colour, for example solid black, tabby, or colourpointed.
# </p>
# <p>
#   There are various patterns of a bicolour cat. These range from the Van-patterned (colour on the crown of the head 
#   and the tail only) to a solid colour with a throat locket or medallion. Bicolour coats are found in many cat breeds, 
#   as well as being common in domestic longhair and domestic shorthair cats.
